This is a collection of tests for the mathematical paper
"Bialternant formula for Schur polynomials with repeating variables"
by Luis Angel Gonz√°lez-Serrano and Egor Maximenko (2024).

Here, we test formulas from the new version of the paper,
where the degrees of polynomials are increasing by rows.

In the project https://github.com/EgorMaximenko/schur_rep,
we have tested the old version of the paper,
where the powers of polynomials are decreasing by rows.
